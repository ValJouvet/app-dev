## Japan Anime Series

**One Piece** is the name the world gave to all the treasure gained by the Pirate King **Gol D. Roger**. At least a portion of it once belonged to **Joy Boy** during the Void Century.
The treasure is said to be of unimaginable value and is currently located on the final island of the Grand Line: _Laugh Tale_.

The **One Piece** is the driving goal of **Monkey D. Luffy** and his crew as well as that of multiple other pirates
who all seek to claim the treasure in order to become the next Pirate King following **Roger's** dying words at his execution.
